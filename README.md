## ‚ö° Quickstart

Already cloned the repo and set up your `.env`?

Just run:
`npm run dev`

## üÜï First-Time Setup

1. Clone repo to your device
2. Cd into folder
3. Make a .env folder in the root directory, use the .env.example as a scaffold to put in your personal env variables
4. Run npm install to download dependencies
5. Run npm run dev to start dev server
6. Navigate to localhost:3000 to view app

That's it!

### üîê Configure Environment Variables

We use a `.env` file to manage secrets and environment-specific settings. You can use the .env.example file as a scaffold

NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = longStringOfNumbersAndLetters.apps.googleusercontent.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY =longStringOfNumbersAndLetters
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL = http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_longStringOfNumbersAndLetter
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL = url

## [üßØ Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting)

If you get a bug that doesn't occur when you test on another machine then you likely will need to delete node_modules and re-run npm install
If you get a bug where the code doesn't match what's rendered, try deleting .next and rerun npm run build

| Symptom                                                         | Likely Culprit                               | Why Nuking Helps                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Code changes not showing up in browser**                      | Stale `.next` cache                          | Forcing full rebuild fixes it      |
| **Hydration mismatch warnings (server vs client DOM mismatch)** | Old build artifacts                          | Removes cached pages/components    |
| **Hot reload not working**                                      | Corrupted `.next`                            | Fresh cache lets HMR work properly |
| **Random `Cannot find module 'X'`**                             | Broken or missing dependency                 | Reinstalls fresh modules           |
| **Next.js dev server crashes immediately**                      | Corrupted cache or bad dependency resolution | Rebuilds with clean slate          |
| **TypeScript showing phantom errors**                           | Old `.d.ts` files in `node_modules`          | Cleans stale types                 |
| **Different behavior locally vs Vercel**                        | Stale local `.next` build                    | Matches fresh build behavior       |
| **Static images or CSS not updating**                           | Cached assets in `.next`                     | Forces re-generation               |
