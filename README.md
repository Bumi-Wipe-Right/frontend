## ‚ö° Quickstart

Already cloned the repo and set up your `.env`?

Just run:
`npm run dev`

## üÜï First-Time Setup

1. Clone repo to your device
2. Cd into folder
3. Make a .env folder in the root directory, use the .env.example as a scaffold to put in your personal env variables
4. Run npm install to download dependencies
5. Run npm run dev to start dev server
6. Navigate to localhost:3000 to view app

That's it!

### üîê Configure Environment Variables

We use a `.env` file to manage secrets and environment-specific settings. You can use the .env.example file as a scaffold

NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = longStringOfNumbersAndLetters.apps.googleusercontent.com

- go to https://console.cloud.google.com/

- select clients

![alt text](image.png)

- Click copy Oauth Client, this is the client ID for this env variable

![alt text](image-4.png)

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = url

- Click the cog icon on the bottom left to get to settings, then click Data API
  ![alt text](image-8.png)

- Click the copy icon, then paste the url in your env file

![alt text](image-9.png)

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY =longStringOfNumbersAndLetters

- needed for the supabase.ts file

- select project settings
  ![alt text](image-6.png)

- click to copy icon, this is what you need for this env variable

![alt text](image-7.png)

NEXT_PUBLIC_URL = http://localhost:3000

- this will be the url you'll use for testing, so it will likely be localhost:3000. On the deployment itself (ex netlify) this will updated to the actual frontend name

NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_longStringOfNumbersAndLetter

- login to stripe

- click home

![alt text](image-12.png)

- to the right you'll see the api keys, click to copy the string

![alt text](image-13.png)

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL = url

- this will depend on your backend, copy and paste the backend's deploy url here

## üß∞ Prerequisites & Tooling

This project assumes you're using **VS Code** as your editor.

### üíª VS Code Extensions

- (Optional but strongly recommended) Prettier
  - an opinionated code formatter.
  - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode
  - If you don't use it then manually run either:
    `format": "prettier --write .` to automatically have prettier make the recommended adjustments
    `format:check": "prettier --check .` have prettier tell you it's recommendations, and then manually make the adjustments

- (Optional but strongly recommended) ESLint
  - Integrates ESLint into VS Code. Lints your code to identify possible problematic coding patterns that violate coding standards.
  - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
  - If you don't use it then manually run:
    `lint": "next lint` runs eslint.
  - However, you would need the plugin to see eslint as-you-type in VSCode.

- (Optional) Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
  - Enhances the Tailwind development experience by providing Visual Studio Code users with advanced features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.
  - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss

- (Optional) Rainbow Tags
  - Inteligently colors all tag pairs in your file. Helps with debugging missing: {}().
    https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=voldemortensen.rainbow-tags

## Deployments

If you need the login function to work with the test deployment you'll have to add the preview deployment to google console

go to https://console.cloud.google.com/

select clients

![alt text](image.png)

click edit OAuth Client

![alt text](image-1.png)

Add the deploy preview link to authorized JavaScript Origins, then scroll down and click save. You don't need to add it to the redirect section below the Authorized JavaScript Origins.

## üßØ Troubleshooting

If you get a bug that doesn't occur when you test on another machine then you likely will need to

- delete node_modules
- re-run npm install

If you get a bug where the code doesn't match what's rendered, try:

- deleting .next
- rerun npm run build

| Symptom                                                         | Likely Culprit                               | Why Nuking Helps                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Code changes not showing up in browser**                      | Stale `.next` cache                          | Forcing full rebuild fixes it      |
| **Hydration mismatch warnings (server vs client DOM mismatch)** | Old build artifacts                          | Removes cached pages/components    |
| **Hot reload not working**                                      | Corrupted `.next`                            | Fresh cache lets HMR work properly |
| **Random `Cannot find module 'X'`**                             | Broken or missing dependency                 | Reinstalls fresh modules           |
| **Next.js dev server crashes immediately**                      | Corrupted cache or bad dependency resolution | Rebuilds with clean slate          |
| **TypeScript showing phantom errors**                           | Old `.d.ts` files in `node_modules`          | Cleans stale types                 |
| **Different behavior locally vs Vercel**                        | Stale local `.next` build                    | Matches fresh build behavior       |
| **Static images or CSS not updating**                           | Cached assets in `.next`                     | Forces re-generation               |
